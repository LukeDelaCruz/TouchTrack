Usage Instructions:
1. Connect and authenticate within GuestUofA Wi-Fi on laptop and mobile.
Note: UWS won't work since it will place devices in different subnets.
Note: You don't have to use GuestUofA, it's your choice.
2. Run the server using:
  python server.py
  or
  python3 server.py
3. Open the app and input the server IP and security code information
generated by the server.
4. Server will give further messages and instructions.

Notes:
* Smoothness and reliability will depend on network stability and phone make.

Assumptions:
* Prerequisites were installed properly
* The server module is being run on a machine

Issues with the program:
* The server is difficult to run within a virtual machine environment since
bridging is necessary.
* Noticeable lag depending on the connection state
*

Wiring instructions:
* None needed
