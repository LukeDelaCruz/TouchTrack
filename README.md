Server instructions:
1. Connect and authenticate within openUWS on laptop and mobile. (Alternately, you can connect to a LAN that places the devices in the same subnet, e.g., UWS will not work for these purposes).
2. Run the python server.
3. Then open the app (AFTER running the server).
4. Type in the IP address given by the server to the app.

Todo:
1. Have a container that allows app to dial into the server's IP
2. Have smooth scrolling.
3. Have authentication and proper termination when connections are lost.
